# rp2040-freertos-CPP-template

This is a template project for developing FreeRTOS based applications on Raspberry Pi RP2040 based boards. 
This template uses the "official" RP2040 port from the Raspberry Pi Foundation.
A stripped down version of FreeRTOSKernel V10.6.2 is included in the project. 
All other ports except RP2040 port have been removed to reduce disk usage.

The drivers included in the project are interrupt driven and require FreeRTOS to work correctly.
