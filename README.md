# Branches

main: Stable branch containing the official released code.

dev: Integration branch for testing new features before merging into main.

Personal branches (Petja, Sampo, Amaury, Tong): Each team member works on their feature here.

# Workflow Steps

 - Develop on personal branch
 - Each member works on their feature in their own branch until it is fully functional.

 - Merge into dev for integration testing

 - Once the feature is working, merge it into dev.
 - Test the combined features in dev to ensure everything works together.

 - When dev is stable and tested, merge it into main.

Optionally, create a new version tag for the release.
